Final Project Proposal
======================

Team Members
------------
- Amy Tsai (-dj)
- Caleb Wang (-bb)
- Edwin Xie (-ed)
- Jason Ye (-di)

Project Description
-------------------
We plan to implement a __particle based fluid simulation__ within a predefined container with the following features:

- real time interactions with the fluid
- fluid interactions with solid objects (splashing)
- surface reconstruction based on particles

Methods
-------
We will be implementing our project as a web application using JavaScript and WebGL. Additionally, we plan to use a Lagrangian, particle based method.
	
Work Division
-------------
We plan to divide our project into the following portions, and will allocate the parts to our team members according to interest:

- implementation of SPH equations
- rendering and display using WebGL
- surface reconstruction
- interactions with solid objects

Extra Features
--------------
If we finish the basic simulation of our project early, we will work on the following extra features:

- realistic fluid rendering with reflections, refractions and cuastics
- allow music interactions with fluid

	
Staff Approval
--------------
We discussed our project with Aayush during his office hours on Thursday
